### What is TRUST4?

Tcr Receptor Utilities for Solid Tissue (TRUST) is a computational tool to analyze TCR and BCR sequences using unselected RNA sequencing data, profiled from solid tissues, including tumors. TRUST4 performs de novo assembly on V, J, C genes including the hypervariable complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) and reports consensus of BCR/TCR sequences. TRUST4 then realigns the contigs to IMGT reference gene sequences to report the corresponding information. TRUST4 supports both single-end and paired-end sequencing data with any read length. 

### Install

1. Clone the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/liulab-dfci/TRUST4), e.g. with `git clone https://github.com/liulab-dfci/TRUST4.git`

You will find the executable files in the downloaded directory. If you want to run TRUST4 without specifying the directory, you can either add the directory of TRUST4 to the environment variable PATH or create a soft link ("ln -s") of the file "run-trust4" to a directory in PATH.

The provided executables are compiled in GCC v7.3.0.

2. We also provide the [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/singularity/) container at https://github.com/liulab-dfci/TRUST4/releases. 

### Usage

	Usage: ./run-trust4 [OPTIONS]
		Required:
			-b STRING: path to bam file
			-1 STRING -2 STRING: path to paired-end read files
			-u STRING: path to single-end read file
			-f STRING: path to the fasta file coordinate and sequence of V/D/J/C genes
		Optional:
			--ref STRING: path to detailed V/D/J/C gene reference file, such as from IMGT database. (default: not used). (recommended) 
			-o STRING: prefix of output files. (default: inferred from file prefix)
			-t INT: number of threads (default: 1)
			--barcode STRING: if -b, bam field for barcode; if -1 -2/-u, file containing barcodes (defaul: not used)
			--barcodeRange INT INT CHAR: start, end(-1 for lenght-1), strand in a barcode is the true barcode (default: 0 -1 +)
			--abnormalUnmapFlag: the flag in BAM for the unmapped read-pair is nonconcordant (default: not set)
			--noExtraction: directly use the files from provided -1 -2/-u to assemble (default: extraction first)
			--stage INT: start TRUST4 on specified stage (default: 0)
				0: start from beginning (candidate read extraction)
				1: start from assembly
				2: start from annotation
				3: start from generating the report table
				
with Singularity container, you just need to run TRUST4 with:
	
	singularity exec ../trust4-singularity.sif /TRUST4/run-trust4

### Input/Output

The primary input to TURST4 is the alignment of RNA-seq reads in BAM format(-b), the file containing the genomic sequence and coordinate of V,J,C genes(-f), and the reference database sequence containing annotation information, such as IMGT (--ref).

An alternative input to TRUST4 is the raw RNA-seq files in fasta/fastq format (-1/-2 for paired; -u for single-end). You still need the files like -f, --ref from above. In this case, you can directly use IMGT's seuqence file for -f. 

TRUST4 outputs several files. trust_raw.out, trust_final.out are the contigs and corresponding nucleotide weight. trust_annot.fa is in fasta format for the annotation of the consensus assembly. trust_cdr3.out reports the CDR1,2,3 and gene information for each consensus assemblies. And trust_report.tsv is a report file focusing on CDR3 and is compatible with other repertoire analysis tool such as VDJTools. 

Each header of trust_annot.fa is split into fields:

	consensus_id consensus_length average_coverage annotations

"annotations" also has several field, corresponding to annotation of V,D,J,C, CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 respectively. For the annotation of the genes, it follows the pattern 

	gene_name(reference_gene_length):(consensus_start-consensus_end):(reference_start-reference_length):similarity
	
Each type of genes has at most three gene candidate ranked by their similarity. For the annotation of CDRs, it follows the pattern:

	CDRx(consensus_start-consensus_end):score=sequence
	
For CDR1,2, score is similarity. for CDR3, score 0.00 means partial CDR3, score 1.00 means CDR3 with imputed nucleotides and other numbers means the motif signal strength with 100.00 as strongest.

The coordinate is 0-based.

The output trust_cdr3.out is a tsv file. The fields are:

	consensus_id	index_within_consensus	V_gene	D_gene	J_gene	C_gene	CDR1	CDR2	CDR3	CDR3_score	read_fragment_count CDR3_germline_similarity

The output trust_report.tsv is a tsv file. The fileds are:
	
	read_count	frequency(proportion of read_count)	CDR3_dna	CDR3_amino_acids	V	D	J	C 

For frequency, the BCR(IG) and TCR(TR) chains are normalized respectively. 

### Practical notes

* Build custom V,J,C gene database (files for -f and --ref)

To generate the file specified by "-f", you need the reference genome of the species you are interested in and corresponding genome annotation GTF file. Then you can use command 
	
	perl BuildDatabaseFa.pl reference.fa annotation.gtf bcr_tcr_gene_name.txt > bcrtcr.fa

to generate the input for "-f". The "bcr_tcr_gene_name.txt" is provided as "human_vdjc.list" in the repository.

Normally, the file specified by "--ref" is downloaded from IMGT website, For example, for human, you can use command

	perl BuildImgtAnnot.pl Homo_sapien > IMGT+C.fa

The available species name can be found on [IMGT FTP](http://www.imgt.org//download/V-QUEST/IMGT_V-QUEST_reference_directory/).

* Single-cell data, e.g. 10X Genomics data:

When given barcode, TRUST4 only assembles the reads with the same barcode together. For 10X Genomics data, usually the input is the BAM file from cell-ranger, and you can use "--barcode" to specify the field in the BAM file to specify the barcode: e.g. "--barcode CB".

If your input is raw sequence, you can use "--barcodeRange" to tell TRUST4 how to extract barcode information.

In the output, the abundance in the report will use the number of barcodes for the CDR3 instead of read count. TRUST4 will also generate the file trust_barcode_report.tsv. In this file, TRUST4 will pick the most abundance pair of chains as the representative for the barcode(cell). The format is:

	barcode	cell_type	IGH/TRB/TRD_information	IGK/IGL/TRA/TRG_information	secondary_chain1_information	secondary_chain2_information

For the chain information it is in CSV format:
	
	V_gene[,D_gene],J_gene,C_gene,cdr3_nt,cdr3_aa,read_cnt,CDR3_germline_similarity

* Simple report

The last step of generating simple report can be done with the command:

	perl trust-simplerep.pl trust_cdr3.out > trust_report.out

If you are interested in a subset of chains, you can "grep" those from trust_cdr3.out and run trust-simplerep.pl on the subset.

### Example

The directory './example' in this distribution contains one BAM files as input for TRUST4. Run TRUST4 with:

	./run-trust4 -b example/example.bam -f hg38_bcrtcr.fa --ref human_IMGT+C.fa

The run will generate the files TRUST_example_raw.out, TRUST_example_final.out, TRUST_example_annot.fa, TRUST_example_cdr3.out, TRUST_example_report.tsv and several fq/fa files.
